The market already \"priced it in\" by selling earlier. What matters isn't the headline itself, but whether it surprises the buyers and sellers."

Trends can last longer than you expect. Trying to catch tops and bottoms usually leads to losses. The trend is not a signal to trade against—it's information about the current momentum.\n\nRespecting the trend doesn't mean blindly following it, but it does mean not fighting it without good reason. \"The trend is your friend\" is a cliché because it's true."

Each trade has risk and cost, so more trades usually mean more losses.\n\nChasing candles means jumping in after a big move has already happened. You see a huge green candle and think \"I need to buy now!\" But you're buying at the top, right before it reverses.\n\nUsing too many indicators creates confusion. When five indicators say different things, you freeze or make random decisions."

Watching the market without trading teaches you patterns and patience.\n\nYour job as a beginner is to avoid losing money while you learn.
