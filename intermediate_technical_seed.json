It reacts faster to new price action.\n\nThe 'moving' part means the average updates every period—as new data comes in, old data drops off.

Wait to see if volume picks up and the breakout holds, or wait for a retest of the triangle top (now support) before entering. High-probability setups combine pattern + volume + trend."

That's powerful confluence. Multiple factors pointing the same direction.\n\nA bull flag forming at a key support level, with rising volume and a bullish MACD crossover? High-probability continuation setup.\n\nDon't trade patterns alone. Stack them with:\n- Support/resistance levels\n- Moving averages\n- Volume confirmation\n- RSI or MACD signals\n- Broader trend alignment\n\nThe more factors that agree, the higher your probability of success."
