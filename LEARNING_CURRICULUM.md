## 📚 LESSON TEMPLATE (CRITICAL)

**Every lesson MUST follow this exact structure:**

### 1️⃣ Hook (Relatable Example)
- Start with a simple, real-world analogy
- Make it immediately relatable
- Connect to everyday experience
- Build curiosity

**Example:**
> "Imagine you're at a farmer's market. When everyone wants strawberries but there are only a few boxes left, what happens to the price? That's supply and demand - and it works exactly the same way in markets."

### 2️⃣ Core Concept (Plain Language)
- Explain like teaching a friend
- No jargon without explanation
- Use short sentences
- Focus on WHY, not just WHAT

**Example:**
> "Support is a price level where buying pressure tends to emerge. Think of it as a floor where buyers step in. When price approaches support, traders expect it to bounce - and those expectations often become self-fulfilling."

### 3️⃣ Visual Section
- Describe the image/chart needed
- Be specific about annotations
- Include color coding
- Show real market data

**Example:**
> **[Visual Needed]**
> - Chart: BTC/USD daily, last 3 months
> - Annotations:
>   - Support line at $40,000 (green dashed)
>   - Three bounce points circled
>   - "Buyers step in here" labels
>   - Recent break below support (red arrow)

### 4️⃣ Real Market Example
- Use recent, recognizable assets
- BTC, ETH, SPY, AAPL, TSLA preferred
- Walk through specific scenario
- Show both success and failure cases

**Example:**
> "In March 2024, Bitcoin found support at $60,000 three times. Each time price approached this level, buyers stepped in aggressively. On the fourth test, it broke down with high volume - signaling the support had failed."

### 5️⃣ Common Mistakes
- Bullet points only
- Based on real user errors
- Specific and actionable
- Warning tone without fear

**Example:**
> Common Mistakes:
> - Buying immediately when price hits support (wait for confirmation)
> - Drawing support lines through candle wicks instead of bodies
> - Ignoring volume on support tests
> - Treating all support levels as equal strength
> - Not having a plan if support breaks

### 6️⃣ When It Fails
- Critical for credibility
- Show limitations honestly
- Teach how to recognize failure
- Emphasize risk management

**Example:**
> **When Support Breaks:**
> Support fails when selling pressure overwhelms buying interest. Signs include:
> - High volume break below support
> - No immediate reclaim attempt
> - Acceleration of selling after break
> - Previous support becomes new resistance
>
> This is why we ALWAYS use stop losses below support levels.

### 7️⃣ Scenario-Based Quiz
- NOT memorization questions
- Real decision-making scenarios
- Multiple valid perspectives
- Focus on thinking process

**Example:**
> **Scenario:**
> BTC is approaching support at $50,000 for the third time in two weeks. Volume is declining on each test. The broader market (SPY) is making new lows.
>
> What do you consider?
> A) Buy immediately - third time's a charm
> B) Wait for a bounce confirmation with volume
> C) Avoid - declining volume and weak market suggests break likely
> D) Short the breakdown if it breaks below $49,500
>
> **Teaching Point:** Multiple answers could be valid depending on your strategy, but the key is considering ALL factors: support tests, volume, broader market context, and having a plan for both bounce and breakdown scenarios.
